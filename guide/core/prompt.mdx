## What is a prompt?
A prompt is your instruction for how the bot should chat.  It determines most of your AI’s behavior. Usually, it’s just a couple of sentence and it’s one of the 3 questions needed to create your bot.  For example, if you’d like a customer service bot, your prompt is as simple as “You are a customer service AI for Acme Realty that answers questions based on the following information provided”. We provide prompt templates so just need to add any special instructions.
