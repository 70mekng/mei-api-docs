Make AI agents that can chat with your customers naturally. Follow this guide to create your own custom AI agent in minutes using our no-code builder - no technical skills required.

## 1. Sign up
Sign up, hit 'create new bot'. Type in a name and greeting. Choose your AI Agent's main function to auto-fill initial instructions called the “prompt”. It's written in plain language, so edit the prompt however you'd like. Hit ‘create' and your AI is ready!

## 2. Start Chatting
Chat using your AI Agent's unique weblink. Add your phone number to have it text you so you can keep chatting on SMS.

## 3. Train AI Agent
Revise your prompt or hit the 'thumbs down' button next to any message and correct the answer so it gets smarter. Add training data by clicking-and-dragging documents or copying in URLs.  

## 4. Share AI Agent
Share your bot's link with others. You get 20 bot messages to test for free.

## 5. Upgrade To Launch
When you're ready to make it live, upgrade your plan. Your AI can initiate a chat with specific users via email or text/SMS.  

Paid users can add a chat widget onto any website by copying & pasting a couple of lines of HTML code into the site editor.  Pro plan users can assign their AI its dedicated phone number, so it could SMS text with any mobile phone number in the US.  We also provide voice agents that can talk like a person when anyone calls their number.
